<br>
2 It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?
I think the ability to have two different users is good because it allows more versatility in writing down code and experimentation.   
<br>
3 Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?
It's because it helps identify location more easily.
<br>
4 Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?
Yes; The name Merlin showed up. This is useful because now it visually shows what directory is being used.

It depends on what situation you find yourself in.
<br>
8.1  What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?
It specifies the program to "sleep" or not to anything for the time specified by the #.
<br>
8.2 Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?
Yes, by putting different intervals of #s.
<br>
9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?
It appears that I cannot see the command I inputted.
<br>
9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?
It will work itself out without interfering with the current thing you are working on.
<br>
9.3 What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?
The time or interval the code will work itself out.
<br>
10.1 What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?
it shows a list of the current jobs running
<br>
10.2 How do you explain your observations?
A list of each job command followed by nothing, a hyphen or plus sign.
<br>
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I Learned the basics of coding, emacs and journaling. the big idea is how to be more efficient in understanding the basics of swift
<br>
What challenges did I encounter?
I'm just starting coding for the first time in my life, so it is a bit difficult.
<br>
How could this experience be improved?
I will study more and if I have time, make it to tutorials. 
<br>
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
It has taught me that this is a class in which I must focus hard
