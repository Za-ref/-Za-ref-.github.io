<h2>1.1: What is Git communicating to you?</h2>
Who the author is, the date, and what just happened.
<br>
<h2>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h2>
Both give general information about who added what file.
<br>
<h2>1.3: Why do you think this is?</h2>
It keeps the organization nice and tidy along with good information. 
<br>
<h2>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h2>
They are displayed in red,  and are said to be modified.
<br>
<h2>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h2>
Both are 'untracked'; I'm assuming it's due to not doing something right, or maybe I'll learn the correct procedure down the road.
<br>
<h2>3: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h2>
They are now green under "Changes to be Committed".
<br>
<h2>Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h2>
File1 is under modified, while File2 is under newfile.
<br>
<h2>4: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h2>
2 files, File1 and File2
<br>
<h2>What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h2>

<h2>What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h2>
I may have done something wrong in 'git commit', but nothing changed for me in git diff/--cached.
