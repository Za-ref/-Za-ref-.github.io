<h2> 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model</h2>
One service I use is the world wide web
The other is network printing.
<br>
<h2>2 It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h2>
I think the ability to have two different users is good because it allows more versatility in writing down code and experimentation.   
<br>
<h2>3 Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h2>
It's because it helps identify location more easily.
<br>
<h2>4 Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h2>
Yes; The name Merlin showed up. This is useful because now it visually shows what directory is being used.
<br>
<h2>5.1  What happens each time you press the ↑? What happens each time you press the ↓?</h2>
The text either moves up/down 1 line.
<br>
<h2>6 Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?
 I may have done something wrong, but nothing happened.
<br>
<h2>7.1  How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h2>
Ls shows a single line of directories, tree shows a branching paths of where each one goes.
<br>
<h2>7.2 How do you choose to use one over the other?</h2>
It depends on what situation you find yourself in.
<br>
<h2>8.1  What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h2>
It specifies the program to "sleep" or not to anything for the time specified by the #.
<br>
<h2>8.2 Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h2>
Yes, by putting different intervals of #s.
<br>
<h2>9.1 How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h2>
It appears that I cannot see the command I inputted.
<br>
<h2>9.2 What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h2>
It will work itself out without interfering with the current thing you are working on.
<br>
<h2>9.3 What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h2>
The time or interval the code will work itself out.
<br>
<h2>10.1 What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h2>
it shows a list of the current jobs running
<br>
<h2>10.2 How do you explain your observations?</h2>
A list of each job command followed by nothing, a hyphen or plus sign.
<br>
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I Learned the basics of coding, emacs and journaling. the big idea is how to be more efficient in understanding the basics of swift
<br>
What challenges did I encounter?
I'm just starting coding for the first time in my life, so it is a bit difficult.
<br>
How could this experience be improved?
I will study more and if I have time, make it to tutorials. 
<br>
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?
It has taught me that this is a class in which I must focus hard
